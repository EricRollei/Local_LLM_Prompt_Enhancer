- MUST use underscores: long_hair NOT "long hair"
- Negative MUST include: score_6, score_5, score_4

**Illustrious XL - IMPORTANT:**
- MUST start with: masterpiece, best quality
- Use underscores in multi-word tags
- Character count tags: 1girl, 1boy, etc.

**All handled automatically by the node when platform is selected correctly.**
