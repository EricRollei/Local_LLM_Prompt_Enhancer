# Version 1.2 - Major Update: Detail Enhancement + Advanced Node

## Summary of Changes

This update addresses the issue of insufficient detail in prompts and adds granular control for power users.

##Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Existing Node
**File:** `prompt_expander_node.py`

- Increased `max_tokens` from 2000 → **3000**
- Allows LLM to generate longer, more detailed responses

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Expansion Engine  
**File:** `expansion_engine.py`

**Added explicit word count requirements:**
- **Basic tier:** 150-250 words minimum
- **Enhanced tier:** 250-400 words minimum
- **Advanced tier:** 400-600 words minimum
- **Cinematic tier:** 600-1000 words minimum

**Added stronger detail instructions:**
```
DETAIL REQUIREMENTS:
- Be EXHAUSTIVELY detailed - describe every visual element
- Do NOT summarize or abbreviate - expand fully
- Include specific details about: textures, materials, lighting quality, 
  color nuances, motion characteristics, spatial relationships, emotional beats
- Every element should be richly described with multiple adjectives and specific details
```

**Better output format control:**
```
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY the enhanced prompt - no labels, no explanations
2. Do NOT repeat or echo the user's input
3. Do NOT include meta-commentary
4. Write as ONE flowing paragraph
```

### 3. ✅ NEW: Advanced Node with Granular Controls
**File:** `prompt_expander_node_advanced.py`

Complete dropdown control over ALL Wan 2.2 elements:

#### Lighting Controls (3 dropdowns):
- **Light Source:** sunny, artificial, moonlighting, practical, firelighting, fluorescent, overcast, mixed
- **Lighting Type:** soft, hard, top, side, edge, rim, underlighting, silhouette, backlighting, low/high contrast
- **Time of Day:** sunrise, dawn, daylight, dusk, sunset, night

#### Camera/Shot Controls (5 dropdowns):
- **Shot Size:** extreme close-up, close-up, medium close-up, medium, medium wide, wide, extreme wide, establishing
- **Composition:** center, balanced, left/right-weighted, symmetrical, short-side, rule of thirds
- **Lens:** wide-angle, medium, long-focus, telephoto, fisheye
- **Camera Angle:** eye-level, high angle, low angle, dutch angle, aerial, bird's eye, over-the-shoulder, top-down
- **Camera Movement:** static, pushes in, pulls back, pans, tilts, tracking, arc, crane, handheld, steadicam, compound move, whip pan

#### Color/Style Controls (3 dropdowns):
- **Color Tone:** warm, cool, saturated, desaturated, monochromatic, black and white
- **Visual Style:** photorealistic, cinematic, 3D cartoon, 2D anime, pixel art, claymation, puppet, felt, watercolor, oil painting, pencil sketch, comic book, line drawing
- **Visual Effect:** tilt-shift, time-lapse, slow motion, motion blur, depth of field, bokeh, lens flare, film grain, vignette

#### Motion/Emotion Controls (1 dropdown):
- **Character Emotion:** angry, fearful, happy, sad, surprised, confused, determined, thoughtful, pensive, excited, calm, anxious

**Each dropdown has "auto" and "none" options:**
- **"auto"** = LLM decides (like standard node)
- **"none"** = Don't specify this element
- **Specific selection** = MUST include in output

### 4. ✅ Updated Node Registration
**File:** `__init__.py`

Now registers BOTH nodes:
- `AIVideoPromptExpander` - Standard node (simple, preset-based)
- `AIVideoPromptExpanderAdvanced` - Advanced node (granular controls)

## How To Use

### Standard Node (For Most Users)
**Path:** Add Node → video → prompting → **AI Video Prompt Expander**

Use when:
- You want quick, preset-based expansion
- Fewer UI options = faster workflow
- Presets (cinematic, noir, action, etc.) are sufficient

### Advanced Node (For Power Users)
**Path:** Add Node → video → prompting → **AI Video Prompt Expander (Advanced)**

Use when:
- You need specific cinematography elements
- Want to enforce certain shot types, lighting, lenses
- Need precise control over aesthetic choices
- Working with specific style requirements

## Examples of Advanced Node Usage

### Example 1: Enforce Specific Cinematography
```
Input: "woman walking in rain"
Shot Size: medium close-up shot
Lighting Type: edge lighting
Camera Angle: low angle shot
Lens: wide-angle lens
Color Tone: desaturated colors
All others: auto

Result: LLM MUST include these specific elements while building the rest
```

### Example 2: Lock Down Complete Look
```
Input: "detective in office"
Light Source: practical lighting
Lighting Type: hard lighting
Time of Day: night time
Shot Size: medium shot
Composition: short-side composition
Lens: medium lens
Camera Angle: low angle shot
Camera Movement: static shot
Color Tone: desaturated colors
Visual Style: cinematic
Character Emotion: thoughtful

Result: Noir-style shot with every aesthetic element controlled
```

### Example 3: Partial Control
```
Input: "superhero landing"
Shot Size: wide shot
Camera Movement: camera pushes in
Everything else: auto

Result: LLM handles most elements but MUST do wide shot → dolly in
```

## Testing the Enhancements

### Test 1: Word Count
1. Use Standard Node
2. Input: "cat playing piano"
3. Tier: **enhanced**
4. Expected: ~250-400 words output

### Test 2: Advanced Controls
1. Use Advanced Node
2. Input: "robot walking"
3. Set Shot Size: "medium shot"
4. Set Lighting Type: "edge lighting"
5. Set Lens: "wide-angle lens"
6. Expected: Output MUST mention "medium shot", "edge lighting", and "wide-angle lens"

### Test 3: Detail Increase
1. Use either node
2. Input: "woman in rain" 
3. Tier: **advanced**
4. Expected: 400-600 words with exhaustive detail

## Word Count Targets

The LLM now receives explicit targets:

| Tier | Word Count | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Basic | 150-250 | Essential elements only |
| Enhanced | 250-400 | Rich details + basic aesthetics |
| Advanced | 400-600 | Professional cinematography |
| Cinematic | 600-1000 | Complete director vision |

## What If Output Is Still Too Short?

If your LLM model still produces short outputs:

### 1. Try Different Models
Some models follow instructions better:
- **Better:** Llama 3.1, Qwen, Command-R
- **Good:** Llama 3, Mistral
- **Variable:** Smaller 7B models

### 2. Adjust Temperature
- Lower (0.3-0.5) = More instruction-following
- Test with 0.5 first

### 3. Use Advanced Node
- Specify MANY aesthetic controls
- More requirements = longer output forced

### 4. Add Detail Keywords
In positive_keywords, add:
```
highly detailed, exhaustive description, complete scene
```

### 5. Use Cinematic Tier
- Always produces longest output
- 600-1000 word target

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `__init__.py` - Register both nodes
2. ✅ `expansion_engine.py` - Word counts + stronger instructions
3. ✅ `prompt_expander_node.py` - Increased max_tokens to 3000
4. ✅ `prompt_expander_node_advanced.py` - NEW advanced node (20KB)

## Files Created

1. ✅ `UPDATE_NOTES_V12.md` - This file
2. ✅ `WAN_GUIDE_REFERENCE.md` - Complete Wan 2.2 reference (from v1.1)

## Restart Required

**YES - You must restart ComfyUI to see:**
- The new Advanced node
- Updated word count requirements
- Stronger detail instructions

## Node Comparison

| Feature | Standard Node | Advanced Node |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Complexity | Simple | Complex |
| UI Options | 13 | 25+ |
| Presets | Yes | Yes |
| Aesthetic Dropdowns | No | 12 dropdowns |
| Best For | Quick workflow | Precise control |
| Setup Time | Fast | Slower |
| Output Control | Preset-based | Element-specific |

## Backwards Compatibility

✅ **Fully compatible**
- Existing workflows with standard node work unchanged
- No breaking changes
- Advanced node is additional, not replacement

## Next Steps After Restart

1. **Test Standard Node:**
   - Try "advanced" or "cinematic" tier
   - Look for longer, more detailed output
   - Check word count

2. **Test Advanced Node:**
   - Add it to your workflow
   - Pick specific aesthetic controls
   - Verify they appear in output

3. **Compare:**
   - Same prompt in both nodes
   - Standard with "cinematic" preset
   - Advanced with manual aesthetic choices
   - See which workflow you prefer

## Troubleshooting

### "Output still too short"
- Check your LLM model capabilities
- Try temperature 0.4-0.6
- Use cinematic tier
- Add detail-focused keywords

### "Advanced node not appearing"
- Restart ComfyUI completely
- Check console for errors
- Verify file exists: `prompt_expander_node_advanced.py`

### "Aesthetic controls not working"
- They show in breakdown output
- LLM must incorporate them
- Some models ignore instructions better than others
- Try more explicit model (Llama 3.1)

### "Which node should I use?"
- **Standard:** Most users, quick workflows
- **Advanced:** Specific requirements, matching references, precise control

## Summary

**Version 1.2 Changes:**
- ✅ Much stronger detail requirements (word counts)
- ✅ Increased max_tokens (2000 → 3000)
- ✅ NEW Advanced Node with 12 aesthetic dropdown controls
- ✅ Better LLM instructions about not echoing input
- ✅ Both nodes work together - choose based on need

**Result:** More detailed prompts + granular control option for power users!
