# Version 1.1 Updates - Enhanced Prompt Expansion

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Wan 2.2 Reference Document
**File:** `WAN_GUIDE_REFERENCE.md`

Complete distillation of the Wan 2.2 prompting guide including:
- All aesthetic control elements (lighting, composition, camera, etc.)
- Example transformations showing before/after
- Best practices and common combinations
- Available for your reference anytime

### 2. Dramatically Enhanced System Prompts
**File:** `expansion_engine.py` (completely rewritten)

#### Critical Output Rules Added:
```
1. Output ONLY the enhanced prompt - nothing else
2. Do NOT repeat or reference the user's input  
3. Do NOT include phrases like "Here is the expanded prompt:"
4. Do NOT use labels, explanations, or meta-commentary
5. Write as a single flowing paragraph
```

#### Multiple Examples Per Tier:
- **Basic Tier:** 3 examples showing simple expansions
- **Enhanced Tier:** 3 examples with details and aesthetics
- **Advanced Tier:** 2 examples with full cinematography
- **Cinematic Tier:** 2+ examples with complete director-level descriptions

#### Preset-Specific Examples:
- Cinematic preset: Astronaut in space, boxer before fight
- Noir preset: Detective in alley with full noir aesthetics  
- Action preset: Car chase with kinetic energy
- Each example shows the full tier + preset combination

### 3. Improved Response Parsing
**File:** `expansion_engine.py` - `parse_llm_response()` method

Now aggressively removes:
- Common LLM artifact phrases ("Here is...", "Expanded prompt:", etc.)
- Echoed user input (detects and strips first line if it's the input)
- Meta-commentary and labels
- Multiple cleaning passes for stubborn LLMs

### 4. Cleaner User Prompts
**File:** `expansion_engine.py` - `_build_user_prompt()` method

Changed from:
```
"Expand this text-to-video prompt:\n\n[prompt]\n\nExpand to [tier] tier level..."
```

To:
```
"[prompt] | Required terms: [keywords if any]"
```

Simpler format = less chance LLM echoes it back.

## Testing the Updates

### Quick Test:
1. Restart ComfyUI (to load the updated code)
2. Try a simple prompt: "cat playing piano"
3. **Before:** Might have included "Expand this text-to-video prompt: A cat playing piano..."
4. **After:** Should start directly with "A fluffy orange tabby cat sits..."

### What to Expect:

**Input:** "robot walking through city"

**Old Style Output (what we're fixing):**
```
Expand this text-to-video prompt: robot walking through city

Here is the enhanced prompt:

A sleek humanoid robot walks through a futuristic city at night...
```

**New Style Output:**
```
A sleek humanoid robot with polished chrome plating walks through a neon-lit futuristic city at night. The robot has glowing blue circuit patterns across its body and moves with precise mechanical grace. Towering skyscrapers with holographic advertisements surround it...
```

Clean, direct, ready to use!

## Example Improvements by Tier

### Basic Tier Example
**Input:** "woman in rain"

**Output Now Includes:**
- Subject details: "young woman with long dark hair"
- Scene: "wet city street during heavy rainstorm"  
- Action: "walks slowly... holding black umbrella"
- Basic lighting: "soft glow from streetlights"
- Shot info: "Medium shot, eye-level angle"

### Enhanced Tier Example
**Input:** "chef cooking"

**Output Now Includes:**
- Detailed subject: "professional chef in pristine white uniform"
- Rich scene: "gleaming stainless steel counter in busy restaurant kitchen"
- Motion quality: "expertly flips vegetables... flames leaping dramatically"
- Aesthetics: "Medium close-up shot, practical lighting from overhead fixtures, warm colors"

### Advanced Tier Example
**Input:** "samurai in bamboo forest"

**Output Now Includes:**
- Full professional cinematography terms
- Specific lighting: "side lighting creates edge lighting on silhouette"
- Camera work: "camera slowly pushes in from medium shot to medium close-up"
- Composition: "Centered composition with bamboo creating natural leading lines"
- Color grading: "warm colors transitioning to cool shadows, desaturated tones"
- Lens: "Medium lens"
- Angle: "Low angle shot emphasizing imposing presence"

### Cinematic Tier Example
**Input:** "astronaut floating in space"

**Output Now Includes:**
- Complete subject description (suit details, wear, instruments)
- Fully realized scene (Earth below, void of space, tether movement)
- Choreographed motion (hand reaching, ice crystals, weightless drift)
- Complete camera movement: "slow 180-degree arc shot, starting behind then rotating..."
- Lighting setup: "Backlighting from sun creates rim light... Earth side lit by soft reflected light"
- Technical reasoning for all choices
- Emotional and atmospheric elements
- Professional color grading specifics

## What Each Preset Now Emphasizes

### Cinematic
Examples focus on: Professional lighting setups, motivated camera movements, emotional beats

### Noir  
Examples focus on: High contrast, dramatic shadows, venetian blinds, practical lighting, desaturated colors

### Action
Examples focus on: Kinetic energy, dynamic camera, motion blur, explosive moments

### Surreal
Examples focus on: Dreamlike qualities, unusual elements, ethereal movement

### Stylized
Examples focus on: Artistic interpretation, graphic elements, consistent visual identity

### Random
Picks random elements from the guide for creative exploration

## Files Modified

1. ✅ **expansion_engine.py** - Complete rewrite with examples (23KB → was 14KB)
2. ✅ **WAN_GUIDE_REFERENCE.md** - New comprehensive reference (4.3KB)

## Files Unchanged

- All other files remain the same
- Node interface is identical
- No breaking changes to workflows

## How to Use

Just restart ComfyUI and use the node as before. The improvements are automatic:

1. **Better Instructions:** LLM gets detailed examples for each tier
2. **Cleaner Output:** Aggressive parsing removes echoed content
3. **Reference Available:** Check WAN_GUIDE_REFERENCE.md anytime

## Verification

To verify it's working:
1. Look at the positive_prompt_1 output
2. It should NOT contain "Expand this..." or "Here is..."
3. It should start directly with the enhanced description
4. Compare to your original input - should be dramatically expanded

## Next Potential Improvements

Future enhancements could include:
- Even more examples (currently 10+ examples across tiers)
- Style-specific vocabulary emphasis
- Better handling of technical keywords
- Prompt analysis and suggestions
- A/B comparison tools

## Questions?

If outputs still include echoed content:
1. Check which LLM model you're using (some follow instructions better)
2. Try temperature 0.3-0.6 for more instruction-following
3. Check the status output for any errors
4. Look at WAN_GUIDE_REFERENCE.md to see what's being taught
