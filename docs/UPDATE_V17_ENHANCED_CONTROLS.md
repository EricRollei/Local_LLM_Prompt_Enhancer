# Text-to-Image Node Update v1.7 - Enhanced Controls

## Date: October 16, 2025

## Overview
Updated the Text-to-Image Prompt Enhancer node with enhanced controls for prompt generation, including proper reference image usage and additional creative controls similar to the Advanced Video Prompt Expander node.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Fixed Reference Image Usage

**Previous Behavior:**
- Reference images were accepted as input but barely used
- Only noted as "[Image provided as reference]"
- LLM didn't receive meaningful information about the images

**New Behavior:**
- **Enhanced Image Analysis** (`_get_simple_image_description`):
  - Analyzes image dimensions and aspect ratio (landscape/portrait/square)
  - Determines brightness level (bright/balanced/dark)
  - Analyzes color dominance and saturation (warm tones/cool tones/monochromatic)
  - Provides descriptive characteristics: e.g., "Reference 1: landscape 1024x768, bright lighting, warm tones, reddish hues"
  
- **Improved LLM Integration** (`_build_user_prompt`):
  - Reference image characteristics are now prominently included in the prompt
  - LLM receives explicit instruction to incorporate visual characteristics
  - Format: Multi-line description with clear emphasis on what to use from references

**Example Output:**
```
Reference images provided - Use these characteristics to inform the enhanced prompt:
  - Reference 1: landscape 1920x1080, bright lighting, cool tones, bluish hues
  - Reference 2: portrait 768x1024, balanced lighting, warm tones, reddish hues
Incorporate the visual characteristics (composition, lighting, color tones, mood) from these reference images into your enhancement.
```

### 2. ✅ Added Prompt Length Control

**New Input:** `prompt_length`

**Options:**
- `auto` - Let LLM decide based on platform optimal length (default)
- `very_short` - 20-40 tokens (minimal, concise)
- `short` - 40-80 tokens (brief but descriptive)
- `medium` - 80-150 tokens (balanced detail)
- `long` - 150-250 tokens (detailed descriptions)
- `very_long` - 250-400 tokens (maximum detail, complex scenes)

**How It Works:**
- Target length is passed to LLM in system prompt
- LLM adjusts output complexity accordingly
- Useful for platforms with different token budgets
- Helps control generation costs and prompt complexity

**Use Cases:**
- **Very Short**: Quick concepts, simple subjects
- **Short**: Standard SDXL prompts
- **Medium**: Flux, balanced descriptions
- **Long**: Complex scenes, Chroma/Meissonic
- **Very Long**: Highly detailed narratives, multiple subjects

### 3. ✅ Added Genre/Style Control

**New Input:** `genre_style`

**Options:**
- `auto` - LLM decides based on content (default)
- `random` - Randomly selects a style
- `none` - No specific genre guidance
- **Creative Genres:** surreal, cinematic, dramatic, action, humorous, indie, artistic, documentary, minimalist, maximalist, fantasy, noir, cyberpunk
- **Content Rating:** x-rated, pg, romantic
- **Era:** vintage, modern
- **Technical:** scifi, horror

**Each Genre Includes Guidance:**
- **surreal**: "dreamlike, unexpected juxtapositions, reality-bending elements"
- **cinematic**: "film-like quality, dramatic lighting, professional composition"
- **dramatic**: "high contrast, emotional intensity, dynamic tension"
- **action**: "dynamic motion, energy, movement, intensity"
- **horror**: "dark atmosphere, ominous mood, eerie elements, tension"
- **noir**: "dark, moody, high contrast shadows, mystery"
- **cyberpunk**: "neon, futuristic dystopia, tech, gritty urban"
- **pg**: "family-friendly, clean, wholesome, appropriate for all ages"
- *(and more...)*

**How It Works:**
- Selected genre/style is passed to LLM with descriptive guidance
- LLM infuses the prompt with appropriate mood, atmosphere, and aesthetic
- Works across all platforms with platform-specific adaptations

**Example:**
- Input: "a woman in a city"
- Genre: `noir`
- Output: "dark moody portrait, film noir aesthetic, woman silhouetted against neon-lit rain-soaked streets, high contrast shadows, mysterious atmosphere..."

---

### 4. ✅ Added Subject Framing Controls

**New Input:** `subject_framing`

**Options:**
- `auto` - LLM decides (default)
- `random` - Random selection
- `none` - No specific framing
- **Shot Types:** 
  - `extreme close-up` - Very tight, facial details
  - `close-up` - Face and shoulders
  - `medium close-up` - Chest up
  - `medium shot` - Waist up
  - `medium wide` - Knees up
  - `wide shot` - Full body with surroundings
  - `full body` - Complete subject, minimal background
  - `cowboy shot` - Mid-thigh up (classic western)
  - `bust shot` - Chest and head
  - `head and shoulders` - Portrait framing
  - `three-quarter` - 3/4 view of body

**New Input:** `subject_pose`

**Options:**
- `auto` - LLM decides (default)
- `random` - Random selection
- `none` - No specific pose
- **Static Poses:** standing, sitting, lying down, kneeling, crouching, relaxed
- **Dynamic Poses:** action pose, walking, running, jumping, dancing
- **Portrait Poses:** portrait pose, contrapposto, asymmetric
- **Energy:** dynamic, static, tense

**How It Works:**
- Selected framing and pose are incorporated into the LLM instructions
- LLM structures the prompt to emphasize these elements
- Particularly useful for character/portrait generation
- Works with all platforms, adapted to platform prompting style

**Example:**
- Framing: `close-up`
- Pose: `contrapposto`
- Result: Enhanced prompt emphasizes facial detail with classic contrapposto stance

4. Verify the enhanced prompt reflects the image's characteristics (lighting, colors, composition)

**Expected:**
- If reference is bright landscape with blue tones, prompt should include similar lighting/color descriptions
- Settings display should show reference image analysis

### 2. Test Prompt Length
**Test Cases:**
```
very_short: Should generate ~20-40 tokens
short: Should generate ~40-80 tokens
medium: Should generate ~80-150 tokens
long: Should generate ~150-250 tokens
very_long: Should generate 250+ tokens
```

**Steps:**
1. Use same basic prompt for all tests
2. Change only `prompt_length` setting
3. Count tokens in output (roughly: words * 1.3)
4. Verify output matches target range

### 3. Test Genre/Style
**Test Prompts:**
```
Prompt: "a woman in a city"

Genre: noir
