## Example Transformations

### Example 1: Basic Expansion
INPUT: "A woman walking in rain"
OUTPUT: "A young woman with long dark hair walks slowly along a wet city street during a heavy rainstorm. She wears a beige trench coat, holding a black umbrella. Rain droplets splash around her feet as she moves through puddles. Streetlights create a soft glow reflecting off the wet pavement. Medium shot, eye-level angle. Overcast lighting, cool colors, desaturated tones."

### Example 2: Advanced Expansion
INPUT: "Robot in futuristic city"
OUTPUT: "A sleek humanoid robot with polished chrome plating walks through a neon-lit futuristic city at night. The robot has glowing blue circuit patterns across its body and moves with precise mechanical grace. Towering skyscrapers with holographic advertisements surround it, their reflections dancing on wet streets below. Light rain creates a misty atmosphere. The camera tracks alongside the robot at medium shot distance. Mixed lighting from neon signs creates vibrant purple and cyan tones. High contrast lighting, cyberpunk aesthetic, wide-angle lens, eye-level shot moving to low angle as it approaches."

### Example 3: Cinematic Expansion  
INPUT: "Superhero landing from sky"
OUTPUT: "A powerful superhero in a dark blue suit with a flowing red cape descends rapidly from storm clouds above a war-torn city. As they accelerate downward, their cape whips violently in the wind. The hero's fist extends forward in classic landing pose. They impact the ground with tremendous force, creating a massive crater as concrete chunks and dust explode outward in all directions. The shockwave ripples through nearby puddles. The camera executes a dramatic compound move starting high angle wide shot showing the full descent, then quickly dollying in and rotating to a low angle close-up as the hero rises from the crater, backlit by lightning. Edge lighting from the storm creates a powerful rim light on the hero's silhouette. Hard lighting, high contrast, desaturated colors with vibrant blue lightning flashes. Slow motion on impact. Practical dust and debris effects, cinematic color grading with teal and orange tones."
