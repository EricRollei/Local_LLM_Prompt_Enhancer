# v1.9.0 Implementation - COMPLETE âœ…

## Date: October 24, 2025

## Status: Phase 1 Implementation FINISHED

All critical Wan 2.2 alignment changes have been successfully implemented!

---

## âœ… Completed Changes

### 1. Restructured LLM System Prompt (expansion_engine.py)

**Changed:** Core system prompt now uses **shot-based structure** instead of single paragraph

**New Format:**
```
[GLOBAL SETUP - 2-4 sentences]

Shot 1: [Framing + Camera Move]
[Action, parallax, atmosphere]

Shot 2: [New Angle + Camera Move]  
[Escalation, depth cues]

Shot 3: [Final Reveal + Camera Move]
[Ending with "Final shot" termination]

[STYLE/TECH FOOTER + Negatives]
```

**Key Requirements Added:**
- âœ… Shot-based structure mandatory (not optional)
- âœ… Explicit ending cue ("Final shot" or "Final wide reveal")
- âœ… Character identity repetition across shots
- âœ… Camera framing AND movement in every shot

---

### 2. Added Atmospheric Motion & Parallax Requirements

**Added to ALL tier instructions:**

**Atmospheric Motion Section:**
- Foreground: rain streaks, particles, steam, fabric rippling
- Background: mist rising, clouds moving, reflections, shadows
- Environmental: leaves falling, water flowing, smoke drifting

**Example Phrases Provided:**
- "rain streaks diagonally past the lens, catching neon light"
- "low mist rises from the lake and drifts across the frame"
- "her long sleeves leave glowing trails as they sweep through air"

**Impact:** Prevents flat, static-looking videos

---

### 3. Enhanced Camera Movement Options (Advanced Node)

**Added 7 new camera movements:**
- `camera orbits around subject`
- `smooth glide`
- `locked-off shot`
- `crash zoom in`
- `camera cranes up`
- `camera cranes down`

**Added 2 new shot angles:**
- `first-person POV`
- `profile close-up`

**Total camera_movement options:** 24 (was 17, +41% increase)

---

### 4. Added Reference Image Mode (Image-to-Video Node)

**New Parameter:** `reference_mode` dropdown with 4 options

**Modes:**
1. **recreate_exact** (default)
   - "Use the provided image as the exact character and costume reference. Keep the same face, hair, outfit, and lighting. Animate this character without changing identity."

2. **style_transfer**
   - "Match the lighting, color palette, and cinematic mood of the provided image, but create a new pose and new scene."

3. **character_remix**
   - "Loosely base the main character on the provided image, but change the outfit and relocate them to a new setting."

4. **face_only**
   - "Preserve ONLY the subject's face and body identity from the provided image. Ignore the original background and lighting. Place this character in the new described scene."

**New Method:** `_build_combined_prompt_with_mode()` includes explicit mode instruction in LLM prompt

---

### 5. Enhanced Negative Prompts (Wan 2.2 Style)

**Updated:** `generate_negative_prompt()` now accepts `visual_style` parameter

**For photorealistic/cinematic:**
```
no subtitles, no on-screen text, no watermarks, no logos, 
no extra limbs, no deformed hands, no distortion, not low quality
```

**For anime/stylized:**
```
no photoreal skin texture, no live-action lighting, no watermarks, 
no subtitles, keep clean cel shading, no flicker, no jitter
```

**Auto-applied** based on visual_style in Advanced Node

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Improvements

Users should see:
- âœ… **Better temporal progression** - Clear shot 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 structure
- âœ… **More dynamic camera work** - Compound moves, orbits, cranes
- âœ… **Improved depth perception** - Atmospheric motion creates parallax
- âœ… **Cleaner endings** - Explicit "Final shot" prevents awkward loops
- âœ… **Better identity consistency** - Reference mode prevents drift
- âœ… **Professional cinematography** - Wan 2.2-optimized language

## ðŸŽ¯ Before/After Example

### BEFORE (v1.8.1 - Single Paragraph):
```
A graceful woman in flowing white Hanfu dances at the edge of a moonlit lake at night, 
her long sleeves catching soft blue rim light as tiny birds of glowing spirit energy 
blossom from her fingertips and circle her in synchronized motion, leaving shimmering 
trails through the air while the dark water reflects their luminous glow and faint mist 
drifts across the scene, creating an ethereal wuxia fantasy atmosphere with cinematic 
realism and smooth motion at 24fps... [continues for 400 words]
```

### AFTER (v1.9.0 - Shot Structure):
```
A graceful woman in flowing white Hanfu dances at the edge of a moonlit lake at night. 
Soft blue rim light outlines her sleeves, and faint mist drifts across the water. Glowing 
spirit-bird particles gather around her hands. Cinematic realism, ethereal wuxia mood.

Shot 1: Close-up, Slow Dolly In
The camera starts in a close-up on her hands. She turns her wrists with elegant precision, 
and tiny birds of light blossom from her fingertips. Their wings glow softly and leave 
shimmering trails in the air. Slow dolly in toward her glowing fingertips.

Shot 2: Medium Shot, Orbital Arc
The camera eases back to a medium shot and begins a smooth orbital arc around her to the 
left. Her long sleeves sweep through the air, leaving ribbons of light. The spirit birds 
circle her in synchronized motion. Mist drifts between camera and subject.

Shot 3: Overhead Crane Reveal (Final Shot)
The camera cranes upward and tilts down to an overhead view. The glowing birds form a 
radiant halo around her on the lakeshore, their reflections flickering on the black water. 
Final wide reveal, majestic and otherworldly.

24fps, 1280Ã—720, cinematic realism, smooth motion.
Negative: no subtitles, no on-screen text, no watermarks, no extra limbs, no deformed hands.
```

**Improvements:**
- âœ… Clear 3-shot progression
- âœ… Specific camera moves per shot
- âœ… Atmospheric motion in every shot ("mist drifts")
- âœ… Explicit ending ("Final wide reveal")
- âœ… Negative prompt included
- âœ… Easier to read and parse

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### To Test Implementation:

1. **Restart ComfyUI** to load updated nodes
2. **Create test workflow:**
   - Add Advanced Prompt Expander node
   - Try short prompt: "A robot exploring an ancient temple"
   - Set detail_level to "enhanced" or "advanced"
   - Check output format (should be shot-based)

3. **Test Image-to-Video:**
   - Add Image-to-Video node
   - Load reference image
   - Try different reference_mode options
   - Verify mode instruction appears in output

4. **Compare outputs:**
   - Same prompt in v1.8.1 vs v1.9.0
   - Should see structured shots instead of paragraph

### To Commit (When Ready):
